# ATMega1284 Module
We found that we faced challenges when we got a project that prioritized board size, periperal, and resources. Therefore, we designed a module to facilitate our work. This module uses ATMega1284 as the main control. We also added CP2102 as USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers. We use a 20MHz oscillator and expand all the ATMega1284 peripherals.

# Board Design
We use KiCAD to design our boards. We include everything for you to be able to develop again.

# Our hope
Actually we really want to print this module. However, we have limited research and resource costs. If you are willing to help us, we will be very grateful. Furthermore, we present everything we have done. Hope you can use it.
